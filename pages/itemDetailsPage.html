            <p class="card-description">Have you been afraid of airplanes all your life and prefer to travel by train?
                You have a truly unique opportunity to try yourself as an aircraft captain and make sure that modern
                technology is safe. All this can be done without leaving the ground.
            <h3>Why should you try a flight simulator?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>An experienced instructor is waiting for you in the cockpit, who will competently supervise the
                    flight.
                </li>
                <li>The GLOBAL CANVAS visualization system from Diamond will give you the opportunity to experience the
                    flight realistically.
                </li>
                <li>The cockpit of the simulator consists entirely of original components, which ensures 100% similarity
                    with a real aircraft.
                </li>
                <li>The behavior of an engine like a jet engine is very close to reality.</li>
            </ul>
